Kalman
======

This BlackBerry 10 WebWorks extension provides additional APIs supplying information about the device accuracy when using GPS.

Its at the top of my todo list

Take two points....

Calculate the distance between them

Try that with GPS (jumps all over the place)

A simple solution is least squares but kalman is far better
